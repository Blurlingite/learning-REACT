<!-- Developer Environment needs these 3 links so the browser can understand REACT and JSX: -->

<!-- REACT LIBRARY -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@15.5.4/dist/react.js"></script>

<!-- REACT DOM LIBRARY -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@15.5.4/dist/react-dom.js"></script>

<!-- BABEL LIBRARY, so you can deal with jsx that we will use in REACT
Babel takes JSX and turns it into pure javascript -->
