// componentDidMount is a lifecycle method that will
// let you use AJAX calls to load data for your component
// you can call setState in this method as well

// we will pass the SWAPI endpoint into the fetch()

// fetch() takes 1 mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch.
// It returns a promise that resolves to the Response to that request, whether successful or not

// The promise object is the completed event or failure of an asynchronous operation and it's value

// we use .then to say what we want to do when this promise is kept

// function(response){} is what we want to do. The "response" parameter represents the
// data we get from the API. That data will be passed in here
// we will use a return statement to turn that response into JSON, so we can use the data
componentDidMount(){
  fetch('http://swapi.co/api/people/')
  // .then(function(response){
  //
  //   return response.json()
  // })

// we are using fat arrow notation here
// response => response.json() is the same as
// function(response){
//
//   return response.json()
// }

// I guess the => is like "function" and the variable before it, is what you would pass in?

// after that we take that data using fat arrow notation and put it in a new variable we made up called "responseData"
// while taking responseData, we set the state (the "items" field in the constructor) to the "results" of the responseData variable
// "results" is what it is called in the SWAPI
// "responseData" is all the promise you get back. If you want the data from that promise, you
// must use responseData.results

// the .catch executes when there is an error getting the data
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(responseData => {
    this.setState({
      items: responseData.results
    });
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log('Fetching and parsing data error', error)
  });
}

// we do items.map and pass in a function to perform on every element in the array (because of the .map)
// each element in the array will be passed into the "item" parameter one by one
// we access the current item's name with item.name
// we assign item.name (because it is unique) to the key because we need a key value so the browser knows which object it has
